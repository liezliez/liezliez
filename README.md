Intros  
:trollface: 
    Hello I am Liezarda, a passionate learner of Internet Of Things and Data Science  
    im a undergraduate student of Telkom University Bandung.  
    Im still learning about the magic world of data science :globe_with_meridians: and endless journey into the holy place of Internet of Things Society :sparkler:  
ðŸ”­ I am using GitHub for my portfolios, every project and code that i did hopefully will stand as a proof of my proficiency as Informatics Undergraduate Student and maybe can also be considered as contribution into coding community.
